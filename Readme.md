#Swift

Swift is the newest programming language from Apple that they plan to eventually replace Objective-C.
It is a compiled language (not interpreted like Python or Javascript).

Important to point out: `Swift != iOS Programming`

Swift is merely a programming language that Apple has built their own frameworks with that we can use to build iOS, OS X, tvOS, and watchOS apps.


Syntactically it is much more approachable:
**Objective-C:**
```objective-c
NSDateFormatter *dateFormatter = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init]; 
[dateFormatter setDateFormat:@"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"];
NSLog(@"%@",[dateFormatter stringFromDate:[NSDate date]]);
```
**Swift:**
  ```swift
let dateFormatter = NSDateFormatter()
  dateFormatter.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
print(dateFormatter.stringFromDate(NSDate()))
  ```

##Swift Basics

####Swift is "strongly typed"
  ```swift
  // type is explicity stated
  let myName: String = "Tom"

  // type can also be inferred unlike Java or Obj-C
  let myName = "Tom"
  ```

####Declaring variables `let` vs `var`
  ```swift
  let someString = "My String"

  var someMutableString = "My mutable string"
  someMutableString = "I can change this string"
  ```
  > Rule of thumb: use `let` unless you know you need to mutate the value held by the variable

####Basic types:
  ```swift
  // Numbers
  let int: Int = 5
  let double: Double = 4.55
  let float: Float = 0.5

  // Arrays
  // array of strings
  let arrayOfStrings: [String] = ["one", "two", "three"]

  // array containing any type
  let arrayOfAnything: [AnyObject] = [1, "two", 3]

  // dictionary
  let myDictionary: [String: String] = ["key": "value", "myName": "Tom"]
  let numberStrings: [Int: String] = [5: "five", 20: "twenty"]
  ```

####Classes
  Swift is an Object-Oriented language making classes are extremely important. 
  Basic Swift class implementation:
    ```swift
       class Car {

         // basic property declaration
         // can change the color of a car with new paint
         var color: String
           // can't really change  the number of doors or cylinders
           let doors: Int
           let numberOfCylinders: Int

           // constructor function used to instantiate class
           init(color: String, doors: Int, numberOfCylinders: Int) {
             self.color = color
               self.doors = doors
               self.numberOfCylinders = numberOfCylinders
           }

         // we can add instance methods to   a class
         func drive(location: String) {
           // drive car to location
         }
       }
       ```

Now outside of class declaration we can create instances of our car class:

```swift
var coupe = Car(color: "red", doors: 2, numberOfCylinders: 6)

// can now call drive on our car instance
coupe.drive(location: "Pizza Hut")

// can also set the properties on our instance provided they are mutable
print(car.color) // "red"
car.color = "blue"
print(car.color) // "blue"

car.doors = 3 // this will cause an error because doors is a let instance property
```

####Optionals
  You'll see in Swift a lot of `?` and `!` 
  These indicate an **optional**. Meaning the variable can either hold a value or it can be `nil`

  ```swift
  // this variable is an Optional
  var optionalString: String? = "This can be nil"

print(optionalString) // "Optional("This can be nil")"

  // exclamation mark force unwraps the optional
print(optionalString!) // "This can be nil"

  // force unwrapping can be dangerous
  optionalString = nil
print(optionalString!) // THIS WILL CRASH YOUR APP

  // two ways to safely unwrap optionals
  if let safeString = optionalString {

    // safeString variable now holds safely unwrappingpped optionalString inside of this block
    print(safeString)
  }

guard let safeString = optionalString else {
  // this block is only executed if optionalString is nil
}
// safeString can be used safely outside of this block
```

####Closures

Closures are used quite heavily in swift similar to callbacks in Javascript.
In swift we cannot pass a function as a parameter, so we use these **closures** or **blocks** to be passed around.

In the example of a jQuery animation
```javascript
$( "#myDiv" ).animate({
opacity: 0.25
}, 5000, function() {
// callback to be executed when animation is complete
})
```

In the example of an iOS animation using swift
```swift
UIView.animateWithDuration(0.8, animations: {
    // this is actually a closure that contains the final values to animate to
    }, 
completion: { success in
// this is a closures that is run when the animation is complete. It is passed 1 parameter, whether the animation completed successfully.
})
```

Closures are declared like so: 
```swift
var someClosure: () -> Void = {
  print("HEYY")
}
someClosuremeClosure() // executes block of code in closure

  // this closure accepts a parameter and returns a string
  var reverseString: (String) -> String
  reverseString = {
    textToReverse in

      return String(textToReverseerse.characters.reverse())
  }

print(reverseString("hey")) // "yeh"
```
